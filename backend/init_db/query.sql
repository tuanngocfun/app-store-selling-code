It is strongly mission based, and the story is loosely based on the comic book series of the same name. There are movies in the franchise which use the same characters as are featured in the game and the original comics.<br><br><br><strong>About the Game</strong><br><br>The basic premise of this game is that the team of characters must find the Eternity Forge, an artefact of great power. The antagonist is Kree Hala the Accuser, who wants it herself. The player plays primarily as Star-Lord, but will occasionally play as the others in the many flashbacks that flesh out the team dynamic and provides characters’ backstories. The humour that made the movies so popular is here too, and carries across well.<br><br>Just as in the movie and the comics, music is important. All the backing tracks to the game are all belters from the 70s and 80s. This is a major connection between Peter (Star-Lord and his past, his childhood and the now mostly defunct Earth. On occasion, you get to choose the background track to inspire the team to a greater effort against the villains.<br><br>The five episodes that comprise the game (see more about this below) play out with plenty of cliff-hanger ups and downs, with a story arc to follow and important player choices to be made. Players can make good choices or bad one, depending on your preferences, and these actions will have sometimes unexpected future consequences.<br><br>The characters on the Milano are all likeable and distinctive: there is Star-Lord, who is cocky, brash, optimistic; Gamora, a world weary cynical warrior; Drax who typifies ‘all brawn and no brain’; Rocket is a sardonic modified raccoon with a dark backstory and Groot is a humanoid tree.<br><br>Nebula and Mantis are not Guardians, per se, but they show up along the way too to help out and hinder as the story demands.<br><br><br><strong>The Nitty Gritty</strong><br><br>The game is strongly team based, with all the characters needed for true success in any scenario. Your AI-controlled fellow Guardians are more than up to the task and ‘remember’ your previous choices and instructions extrapolating them forward, so it really feels as though they are working with you, rather than waiting to be told what to do.<br><br>Along with this, the characters still have their own unique personalities – for example, Drax takes on too many enemies at once, while Gamora is more cautious. Star-Lord loves to shoot, and this can be teamed with jumping, dodging, trying out new moves that you’ve just unlocked, and executing melee strikes. It is up to you to set the team members tasks that they will cope with well.<br><br>The enemies’ health bars can be seen at all times, letting you know if you need all your strength, or just one or two more shots to finish them off which can be useful when you are unsure of whether to press on or fall back to recuperate and regroup.<br><br>Fill your XP bar to unlock unique abilities. You can inspire your team to success by choosing the right inspirational speech or background track. This does more than just make them feel good, it actually gives them boosts and abilities they wouldn’t otherwise have. You can also do things like letting Drax throw Rocket over a ravine to make a bridge quickly – but Rocket might not be so willing to help next time!</p>', 'http://localhost:5000/images/TZv92uvHo9beG8EPaNjghLI5.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/V-maTBVV2nuklp2nI1uyounP.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/74Spe-_ulO4le5Ztg75rSjea.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/aFPvPkzBVDIdya5XWhD0tEz5.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/J1JVE2BedZxZb-nwx4QWY4o0.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/ZzlrskVsW2Fjlf7di1ziqynk.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/zQndgNLAZzJUOeV-6EP8Wux1.webp', '2023-03-29 16:42:53.049199');

It is the PC-friendly version of the 2018 Gods of War, which was initially only available on PlayStation. The game allows PC gamers to enjoy the intense Norse God action-adventure game.<br><br>The game is the eighth in the whole cross-platform series and takes place against a background that while not really being open world and more a series of linked locations, is still wide and explorable within those locations. You seldom feel constrained despite the linear game progression.<br><br>About the Game<br><br>The game’s plot plays out against the background of Norse gods in this iteration, rather than the Ancient Greece of the original games, and it is loosely set in Medieval Scandinavia in the realm of Midgard, which is the Norse equivalent of the lands inhabited by the earliest humans when the world was young.<br><br>There are two protagonists in the game, one of whom is playable. Kratos – a former Greek God of War and only playable character – is accompanied by his young son, Atreus, who looks to be anywhere between eight years old and twelve or so. The two of them are on an honour quest, to dispose of Faye’s (Atreus’s mother) ashes according to her deathbed wish, to have her remains scattered on the highest peak of the nine realms.<br><br>Of course, there would be no story if everything went smoothly, and so, their quest is disrupted by monsters and gods who have other ideas about who should be able to dispose of their earthly remains on the sacred peak. The monsters start off large and scary and steadily get larger and scarier, giving you plenty of scope to improve your skills and then try them out. The combat is wonderful: bloody, brutal and – thanks to the physics engine – satisfying!<br><br>Almost equally satisfying and rare in a game better known for skull-shattering crunches and broken bones, is the arc between Kratos and Atreus. When they set off, they are almost strangers to each other, both feeling that the other expects more of them than they give. This arc progresses along with the game, ending with a much closer, more respectful and loving relationship between the two. And all without impacting the joyous blood-shed!<br><br><br>The Nitty Gritty<br><br>Take a moment before you play, to customise your PC settings to suit your CPU to get the best possible results. You will think it well worth the time, when you see the beautiful scenery that makes even the quiet parts a wonderful experience. During the action sequences you will be too busy to notice your surroundings unless it offers a handy cave to hide in, or rock to shelter behind while you catch your breath!<br><br>Gameplay is equally fluid with either a PlayStation controller (PS4 or PS5 are recommended) or a gaming keyboard and mouse, depending on your set-up and preferences. To celebrate the PC release, Sony gave out some extra content, a number of new skins and even some free armour for you to try on for size.<br><br>Do enjoy the game: the original version won multiple (around 190!) Best Game awards, and for good reason. The action is ‘filmed’ in a continuous shot, the focus of which is always Kratos and his son, making it immediately immersive. The filming style isn’t kitschy or artsy though, it all flows seamlessly, leaving you breathless as you closely accompany your hero.<br><br>Atreus is AI at its best, interacting almost naturally, but also obediently following instructions and enabling you to double your strike rate and power if you time your actions with his – something that the pros make look easy to do!<br><br>Take your time exploring the worlds and learning about the mythology and hidden secrets of the world, or gallop through to finish quickly and then return to cover the bits you missed. There are at least 20 hours or so of content that is not directly related to the game, just waiting to be enjoyed when you explore the beautifully rendered world to its limits.</p>', 'http://localhost:5000/images/3E250cyrYtmUqftixAO4xrsW.png', 'http://localhost:5000/images/SIFRZd2FjgCdw0rQr6kqiWI0.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/17jVLpSODt9cGzMfhDaKQC-9.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/-_5oTFreh0z_2uYc21GKPIVn.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/L8F6omVnUIRcTkjn8_NDJTDt.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/wQ-H4vqYC1sd_MMWc5NXv2ow.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/sgakm2qFJIemAmGBbd-wsO2Q.jpg', '2023-03-29 17:16:20.722569');

He can also accept side quests, interact with NPCs, complete missions and earn tokens, which are the in-game currency which allows you to buy goodies, and unlock new suits and useful gadgets (such as electric webbing, impact webbing which pushes enemies away and makes them stick to whatever they bump into, concussive blast).<br><br>As you play along and progress through the game’s story arc, there are also collectibles to snatch up and additional content to unlock. As might be expected from a Spider-Man game, combat mainly involves web-slinging, using the environment to your best advantage and chaining attacks together to befuddle enemies rather than take them down in face-to-face combat.</p>', 'http://localhost:5000/images/LedO1iwwJ5c7Rh_yzYYm7Vql.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/Or_RKg1tAC6NcYFyQMVUlwho.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/AFn5FbZ18o3OnbbT0K5e41TH.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/ysQtqnZ3w0n2aljEi1R6BmNh.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/Mcu_g5i6cHNZPOwhlNSu2NJA.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/ln_a-mfZzMg6ty6NT-0d1tC6.jpg', 'http://localhost:5000/images/D-6LJterIaScNO-23bZXP4Ln.jpg', '2023-04-14 12:05:46.958533');
